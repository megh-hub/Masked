Masked - The Face you know, The Story you don't

The Problem Statement:

Picture this, you wake up to a blaring cell-phone and your friend asks you to check a link. You click on it and you see what you never thought you would, yourself in a sexually explicit video on a shady site. You are clueless and helpless. Now what!! 


Solution:

We provide a centralized hub for people in such situations to secure their privacy and make an immediate step towards trying to stop people from consuming their content. This platform also makes it such that the reporter can take a step anonymously.

We provide an extension to people who want to be more responsible and ethical about their watching habits. They could download our extention and be fairly certain that the content that they are consuming is consensual and ethical. While the user is browsing, if our extention detects a link that has been reported to our database it will mask the video with a pop-up that when clicked on will redirect the user to the report statement.

By flaging particular videos that are non-consensual and unethical, we are preventing these videos from tainting the whole industry and by reducing views on unethical content, we are automatically increasing the views on ethical content thereby promoting the promotion of ethical pornography and discouraging unethical pornography.

Our site will also contain lots of resources that spreads awareness about the problem and the ways a person can help resolve the problem.

The project will be 100% open source and transparent with the user so that they can feel confident about their anonymity.


Future of the project:

We plan to use video fingerprinting to find copies of reported videos on other sites. 

We can give access of the database to government agencies and the companies hosting these videos so that they can take further action.

To prevent false reports, we might have to consider charging a small fee which will be donated to charities fighting for women rights.
